GR4J hydrological model

GR4J is a rainfall-runoff model. This code allows to calculate discharge from rainfall and evapotranspiration data. The model is calibrated with the nelder mead method and using the Kling-Gupta Efficiency criteria. 
Then, the model is validated with a split_sample test. Finally, it is possible to run a monte carlo simulation to create uncertainty in the parameters of the model.
